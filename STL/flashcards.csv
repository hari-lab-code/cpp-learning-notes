When is it better to choose an associative container over an unordered one?,"When the predictable, sorted iteration order of elements is required for the application's logic."
Why is iteration considered 'stable' in ordered associative containers?,Because the order of elements is predictable and always sorted by the key.
Why is the iteration order of an unordered associative container described as 'undefined'?,"Because it depends on the hash function and the internal state of the hash table, not on the insertion order or key value."
